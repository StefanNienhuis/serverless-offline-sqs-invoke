# Serverless Offline SQS invoke

A Serverless plugin that invokes Lambda functions in response to SQS requests. It mocks the SQS API and uses the defined events to call the corresponding Lambda function.

Note: This project won't be actively maintained. I will be using this internally to suite my needs. If you want to add a feature, feel free to open up a PR.
